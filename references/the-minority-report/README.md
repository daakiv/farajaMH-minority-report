# The Minority Report

> **Originally created for 2025 Hazard Information Profiles (HIPs) from United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.**
> This implementation is based on the novel "The Minority Report" by Philip K. Dick.

An agentic pipeline for generating high-quality multilingual technical translations and controlled vocabularies. The project uses a multi-model approach (Voter/Arbitrator architecture) to translate terms while preserving context and generating standard [Croissant](http://mlcommons.org/croissant/) metadata.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Leverages `gpt-oss:latest`, `gemma3:27b`, and `deepseek-r1:14b` via Ollama.
- **Context-Aware Translation**: Uses "Scope Notes" to ensure technical accuracy.
- **Web Scraping**: Built-in support for extracting terms and definitions from sites like PreventionWeb.
- **Formal Provenance**: Every translation is linked to its source model in both CSV and Croissant metadata.
- **Arbitration Logic**: Automatically resolves disagreements between models by triggering a voting round.
- **Metrics Extraction**: Dynamically extracts quantifiable variables, indicators, and risk drivers from translated technical text using Chain-of-Thought prompting.
- **Semantic Croissant Catalog**: Automatically discovers and indexes all multi-lingual datasets, markdown articles, and metrics JSON objects into a single JSON-LD file.
- **Batch Processing**: Scrape entire indexes of terms and generate metadata in bulk.
- **Dockerized**: Easy deployment and execution without local environment headaches.

## The Golden Standard for AI-Ready Data

The Minority Report's Semantic Croissant Catalog has been independently evaluated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, cementing its status as an elite, "AI-Native" dataset architecture. You can read the full evaluations in the `testimonials/` directory.

- **Gemini 3.1 (Score: 9.8 / 10)**: Rated as "Tier-1 AI-Ready resource." Highlighted the combination of DIDs and UNF signatures as the "Killer Feature" that allows an AI to transition from guessing based on context to knowing based on cryptographic evidence.
- **Gemma4:26b (Score: 9.8 / 10)**: Praised the catalog as an exceptional example of data designed *for* AI. Noted the self-documenting BS4 parsing patterns and the imperative guidance in the `instruction` fields that heavily reduces RAG hallucinations.
- **ChatGPT (Score: 9.0 / 10)**: Characterized the catalog as an evolutionary step beyond standard metadata. Highlighted the integration of Croissant + CDIF + ODRL + DID alongside multi-agent generation provenance, effectively turning dataset descriptions into an "AI execution context."
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Score: 7.4 / 10)**: Confirmed the Croissant 1.0 + JSON-LD stack as the current gold standard. While praising the deterministic URL routing and SHA-256 integrity checks, it correctly observed that the dataset deliberately utilizes specialized language codes (e.g., `ch` instead of `zh`) to test an agent's ability to rigidly adhere to provided structured instructions over its pre-training biases.
- **Grok 4.3 (Score: 9.5 / 10)**: Rated the catalog as an excellent example of AI-Ready data infrastructure. Specifically praised the provenance tracking, explicit model instructions, and multimodal content (HTML, clean text, CSVs, semantic metrics) as key differentiators.
## ODRL Policy Governance

The translation pipeline is strictly governed by an Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) policy (`ODRL/translation_pipeline_odrl.jsonld`). This policy mathematically enforces security, workflow, and quality constraints on the AI agents:

1. **Step 0 - Environment Verification**: The policy mandates that `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, and `OLLAMA_KEYWORDS_HOST` are present. If missing, the API throws an explicit ODRL Policy Violation.
2. **Step 1 - Ingest**: Explicit permission is granted to read from URLs or keyword strings.
3. **Step 2 & 3 - Keyword Extraction & Caching**: The system is permitted to use a secondary, specialized LLM to extract domain keywords, but holds a **duty** to archive them immediately to disk to preserve compute resources.
4. **Step 4 - Primary Translation**: Grants permission to translate the source text using the primary LLM grounded by the cached keywords.
5. **Step 5 & 6 - Validation & Retry**: Imposes a strict duty: the generated translation must be at least 40% of the length of the source text. If this validation fails, the policy mandates a consequence of retrying up to 3 times.
6. **Step 6.5 - Expert Proofreading**: The translated text must be explicitly checked for authoritative terminology, formatting, completeness, and natural flow using the **Language-Agnostic Hazard Classification Proofreader** protocol. This is executed using the designated `--small-model` (e.g., `gemma4:e2b`) to ensure strict adherence without hallucination.
7. **Step 7 - Archiving**: The final validated translation, generated changelog (`_changelog.md`), and structural metadata must be saved following strict directory patterns.

The FastAPI service dynamically parses and enforces these ODRL rules at runtime.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (running on `http://10.147.18.253:11434` by default)

### Local Setup (Optional)
If you prefer running without Docker:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 🚀 Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Build the Environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Index Scraping (Create Cache)**:
   Scrape an entire index page (e.g., PreventionWeb HIPS) to create a local cache of terms, URLs, and codes. This does **not** run translations yet.
   ```bash
   docker-compose run orchestrator --index-url https://www.preventionweb.net/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/ --output-dir data
   ```
   *Output*: `data/index_cache.json`

3. **Run Translations (From Cache)**:
   Process the cached index file to translate all terms.
   ```bash
   docker-compose run orchestrator --index-file data/index_cache.json --languages fr,es,de --models gpt-oss:latest
   ```

   **With OntoPortal Enrichment (Optional):**
   Requires an API key (e.g., from [EcoPortal](http://ecoportal.lifewatch.eu)).
   ```bash
   export ONTOPORTAL_API_KEY="528c4e4a-5c3e-4798-a2e2-11d96761b8ce"
   
   docker-compose run -e ONTOPORTAL_API_KEY orchestrator \
     --index-file data/index_cache.json \
     --ontoportal-url "http://ecoportal.lifewatch.eu:8080"
   ```

4. **Single URL Mode**:
   Directly scrape and translate a single page.
   ```bash
   docker-compose run orchestrator --url https://www.preventionweb.net/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/mh0103 --languages fr,es
   ```

   **OntoPortal-based Pages (e.g. AgroPortal):**
   The tool automatically detects OntoPortal URLs (containing `conceptid`) and uses the API to fetch the authoritative definition.
   ```bash
   export ONTOPORTAL_API_KEY="528c4e4a-5c3e-4798-a2e2-11d96761b8ce"

   docker-compose run -e ONTOPORTAL_API_KEY orchestrator \
     --url "https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/NCBITAXON?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2FSTY%2FT017" \
     --ontoportal-url "http://agroportal.lirmm.fr"
   ```

5. **Generate Batch Croissant Metadata**:
   Generate rich JSON-LD metadata for the entire dataset, enriching it with the HIPS codes and Source URLs from the index cache.
   ```bash
   docker-compose run python3 translation-skill/scripts/batch_croissant.py --input-file data/final_translations.csv --index-file data/index_cache.json --output-dir output/
   ```

6. **Extract Semantic Metrics**:
   Extract variables, indicators, and risk drivers from translated markdown files and store them in the CDIF directory structure. You can pass the `--language` flag to explicitly enforce the target language.
   ```bash
   python3 translation-skill/scripts/extract_metrics.py --hips-code GH0310 --language ru
   ```

7. **Generate Semantic Croissant**:
   Generates a central catalog (`semantic_croissant.json`) that recursively links all translated datasets, `.md` files, and `_metrics.json` records, providing explicit search directives for consumer agents.
   ```bash
   python3 translation-skill/scripts/generate_central_croissant.py
   ```

### 🐍 Using Python Directly

Ensure your `OLLAMA_HOST` is set:
```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://10.147.18.253:11434
python3 translation-skill/scripts/orchestrator.py --url "YOUR_URL" --output_dir data
```

## MCP Server

The Minority Report can be run as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing LLMs to use its translation and scraping tools directly. It provides:
- `understand_and_translate`: Translates a specialized term given its context (Scope Note).
- `open_page_and_translate`: Scrapes a term/context from a URL and translates it.

### How to Start the MCP Server

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastmcp mcp --break-system-packages
   ```

2. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   python3 translation-skill/scripts/mcp_server.py
   ```

3. **Configure MCP Client**:
   Add the following to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop `mcp_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "minority-report": {
         "command": "python3",
         "args": ["/Users/vyacheslavtykhonov/projects/the-minority-report/translation-skill/scripts/mcp_server.py"],
         "env": {
           "OLLAMA_HOST": "http://10.147.18.253:11434"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### How to Use Minority Report MCP

Once configured, you can ask your LLM to perform complex technical translations.

**What to ask:**
- "Open the page https://www.preventionweb.net/... and translate the term into French and Spanish."
- "I have a technical term 'Digital Twin' used in the context of urban planning. Translate it into German and Dutch using The Minority Report."
- "Scrape the latest terminology from this URL and generate a multilingual controlled vocabulary entry."

**Tips:**
- **Provide Context**: The `understand_and_translate` tool works best when you provide a detailed "Scope Note" or definition.
- **Specify Models**: You can explicitly ask for certain models (e.g., `gemma3:27b`) if you need specific language nuances.
- **Batching**: While the MCP tools currenty handle one term at a time, you can ask the LLM to loop through a list of terms.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | The URL of the Ollama API | `http://10.147.18.253:11434` |
| `SPACY_MODEL` | Path to the trained spaCy NER model for MCP server | `training/spacy_hips` |

## Configuration

### MCP Server
The MCP server uses a spaCy model for the `find_hazards` tool. 
- By default, it looks for the model at `training/spacy_hips`.
- You can override this by setting the `SPACY_MODEL` environment variable to the absolute path of your model.

```bash
export SPACY_MODEL=/path/to/your/custom/model
python3 translation-skill/scripts/mcp_server.py
```

## Project Structure
 
 - `translation-skill/scripts/`: Core logic for scraping, translation, and metadata generation.
 - `translation-skill/prompts/`: Markdown-based prompt templates for LLM agents.
 - `training/`: Model training scripts (spaCy NER and Transformers).
 - `tests/`: Verification scripts for the pipeline.
 - `data/`: Input and output CSV files.
 - `output/`: Generated Croissant metadata and SKOS vocabularies.
 - `agents.md`: Detailed documentation on agent architecture and prompts.

## Training Models

The project includes two training approaches for building custom models:

### spaCy NER Model (Recommended)


Train a lightweight Named Entity Recognition model to identify disaster terminology:

**Single-job training:**
```bash
# Install spaCy
pip install spacy

# Train the model (fast, ~1-2 minutes)
python3 training/train-spacy.py --data-dir output --n-iter 30 --test

# Model saved to: training/spacy_model/
```

**Parallel training (for multi-core systems):**
```bash
# Train 16 models in parallel
python3 training/train-spacy.py --data-dir output --n-jobs 16 --n-iter 30

# Monitor progress in another terminal
tail -f training/spacy_model/run_*.log

# Models saved to: training/spacy_model/run_0/, run_1/, ..., run_15/
```

**Advantages:**
- Fast training (1-2 minutes single-job, scales with cores for parallel)
- Small model size (~10MB per model)
- Works on CPU (GPU conflicts resolved via spawn multiprocessing)
- Production-ready
- Parallel training enables model ensembling or selection of best performer

### Transformers Fine-tuning (Advanced)

Fine-tune a Gemma model for translation tasks:

```bash
# Requires CUDA GPU
python3 training/train.py --data-dir output --model-name google/gemma-2-2b-it --max-steps 60
```

**Note:** This approach requires significant GPU resources and may take hours to train.
